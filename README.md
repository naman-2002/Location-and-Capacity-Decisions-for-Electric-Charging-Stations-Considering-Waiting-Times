# Location-and-Capacity-Decisions-for-Electric-Charging-Stations-Considering-Waiting-Times
•  Build a Mixed Integer Linear Programming  (MILP)  model for the optimal location of charging station considering capacity and waiting time.
•  Minimized the number of stops  on the route of a bus and operational cost  (fixed and variable) of the charging station.
•  Implemented the  model in the state Maharashtra with 47 city nodes and  proper city routes,  CPLEX was used to solve  the  problem.
•  Achieved a  maximum capacity of  6  at  Shirdi city node charging station and observed a  5% to 6%  reduction in cost with an increase  in range.
